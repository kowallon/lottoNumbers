1. App scrapes website that provides historical data about lotto numbers.

2. Based on that it inserts to google sheet informations about how many times each number was drawn and what was the last time it was drawn.

3. Then it calculates on average how often is a number drawn

4. With this information, it deducts the last time it was drawn from average space between draws. If for example number is drawn on average in every 6 draws and was drawn 5 draws ago, then it is a decent chance, that it will be drawn next time.


P.S Steps 3 and 4 should be done manually, as free sheety subscription only alows for 200 requests a month so goind through all steps will run out of free requests
